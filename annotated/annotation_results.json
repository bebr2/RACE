        "llm_response": "The European financial crisis, which began around 2007-2008, was rooted in several interconnected factors:\n\n1. **Housing Market Issues**: Similar to the US, Europe experienced a surge in risky mortgage lending, particularly subprime loans, which later led to high foreclosure rates.\n\n2. **Securitization and Derivatives**: European banks, like their US counterparts, bundled mortgages and other loans into securitized products. These were sold to global investors. The use of derivatives, such as credit default swaps, increased risk exposure, creating a vulnerability when asset values declined.\n\n3. **Risky Financial Instruments**: The reliance on complex financial instruments and derivatives, combined with poor oversight, led to significant exposure and instability when these instruments lost value.\n\n4. **Regulatory Failures**: Europe, like the US, had inadequate regulatory frameworks that didn't adequately oversee these financial products, allowing risky practices to persist.\n\n5. **Global Interconnectedness**: The crisis spread globally due to the interconnected nature of international financial markets, with European banks and investors heavily involved in risky securities.\n\n6. **Government and Central Bank Responses**: While interventions like bailouts and quantitative easing were implemented, they may have delayed recovery rather than preventing the crisis, potentially contributing to prolonged economic challenges.\n\n7. **Public Trust Issues**: The crisis eroded public trust in financial institutions, affecting economic behavior and stability.\n\n8. **Eurozone Structure**: The shared Euro currency and diverse economies within the Eurozone exacerbated the impact, as economic troubles in one country could ripple across the region.\n\n9. **Shadow Banking**: Activities outside traditional banking, such as peer-to-peer lending, added to financial instability.\n\n10. **Reforms and Lessons**: Post-crisis reforms, like the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and similar measures in Europe, aimed to enhance financial stability, though their effectiveness in preventing future crises remains to be seen.\n\nIn summary, the European financial crisis was a complex issue rooted in global financial practices, regulatory shortcomings, and Europe's unique economic structure, leading to a severe financial downturn.",

Without specific birth details for Bertalan Farkas, it is inferred that if Farkas was born after Schlegel, Schlegel would be older. However, if Farkas was born earlier, the age order would reverse. Therefore, the answer hinges on the exact birth years of both individuals.\n\n**Answer:** Without exact birth years, it's challenging to determine who is older.
